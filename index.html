            <h2>Welcome to TPL Journey</h2>
            <p>
              Throughout our walk with God, we discover that His truth, power,
              and love meet us exactly where we are—and invite us into deeper
              relationship with Him.
            </p>
          </header>
          <p>
            <strong>God's Truth</strong> illuminates our path through Scripture,
            teaching, and the gentle conviction of the Holy Spirit. As we study
            His Word and engage in authentic community, we grow in understanding
            and wisdom, allowing divine truth to transform our minds and shape
            our perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>God's Power</strong> sustains and strengthens us through
            every season. Whether we encounter His miraculous intervention in
            answered prayer, experience His quiet strength during trials, or
            witness His redemptive work in our circumstances, we learn that His
            power is made perfect in our weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>God's Love</strong> is the foundation of everything. It
            reaches us in our brokenness, celebrates with us in our joy, and
            never lets us go. Through worship, fellowship, service, and
            solitude, we experience the depth of a love that pursued us first—a
            love that continually draws us closer to the heart of our Creator.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your journey is unique, and God meets you in ways that speak
            directly to your heart. Whether you're just beginning to explore
            faith or have walked with God for years, there is always more to
            discover about His infinite truth, power, and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're here to walk alongside you, offering resources, encouragement,
            and community as you grow in your relationship with God.

            <h2>God's Truth: The Way to the Father</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            <strong>John 14:6 (NIV)</strong><br />
            "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one
            comes to the Father except through me.'"
          </p>
          <p>
            In a world filled with competing voices and countless paths, Jesus
            stands as the singular way to the Father. He is not merely one
            option among many—He is the truth that sets the foundation for all
            reality. When we encounter Christ, we discover that truth is not an
            abstract concept but a living person who guides us, transforms us,
            and leads us into authentic relationship with God. Walking in His
            truth means following His example, trusting His words, and allowing
            His Spirit to shape how we think, speak, and live. Through Jesus, we
            find both the destination and the journey, both the answer and the
            guide.

            <h2>God's Power: Empowered for His Mission</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            <strong>Acts 1:8 (NIV)</strong><br />
            "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and
            you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria,
            and to the ends of the earth."
          </p>
          <p>
            The same Spirit who raised Christ from the dead lives in every
            believer, empowering us to be effective witnesses in an unbelieving
            world. This divine power enables ordinary people to do extraordinary
            things—sharing the gospel with boldness, living with integrity in
            difficult circumstances, and demonstrating God's kingdom wherever we
            go. The Holy Spirit's power is not limited by our weaknesses or
            inadequacies; rather, it works most powerfully through yielded
            hearts. Whether in our neighborhoods, workplaces, communities, or to
            the farthest corners of the earth, God's power equips us to
            represent Christ faithfully and fruitfully.

            <h2>God's Love: The Essence of Who He Is</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            <strong>1 John 4:8-9 (NIV)</strong><br />
            "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. This
            is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son
            into the world that we might live through him."
          </p>
          <p>
            Love is not merely one of God's attributes—it is the essence of His
            being. The ultimate proof of this love is not found in words but in
            action: God sent His own Son into our broken world so that we could
            experience true life. This radical act of love defines everything
            about our faith. When we truly know God, we cannot help but be
            transformed by His love and express that love to others. His love is
            not conditional or temporary—it is the foundation upon which our
            entire relationship with Him is built. In receiving His love, we
            discover our purpose: to know Him, to be transformed by Him, and to
            reflect His love to the world around us.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
            No matter where you are in your journey with God—whether you're
            exploring faith for the first time, returning after time away, or
            walking closely with Him for years—His truth, power, and love are
            available to you today. He invites you to encounter Him in new and
            deeper ways, discovering that He is everything you need.
